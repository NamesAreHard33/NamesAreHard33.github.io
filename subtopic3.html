 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This article covers the issue of machines replacing humans as artists, one of the largest fears many artists have as AI generated art develops. This article brings up both visual art as well as poetry and music with specific programs that produce the “art”. It discusses how machines are now performing abstract tasks that were previously believed to only be accomplishable by humans. As the author wonders how this may grow to replace human creativity, she instead decides to think of AI generated art simply as an extension of human creativity and skill; another way humans express themselves.</span><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>This site goes into one of the largest issues that artists face as AI generated art becomes more and more popular. Many artists refuse to use or post on the social media platform, X, due to its upcoming program xAI. This program will use any posts on X to train xAI, what many speculate to be the social media platforms upcoming chatbot program. Even though xAI seems to be a chat bot, many artists are still concerned that this may apply to visual art and images as well. Regardless, written art, such as poems and stories, could very well be used as training for a chat bot, concerning many writers using the platform. A quote by Elon Musk indicates that other platforms are doing the same thing, causing a lot of speculation about what sites and platforms could be using public posts to train their AI.</small><br>
